# lapdMousePythonExamples

**lapdMousePythonExamples** is a collection of Python 3 Jupyter notebooks
that demonstrate how to work with data from the
[Lung anatomy + particle deposition (lapd) mouse archive collection](https://doi.org/10.25820/9arg-9w56).
For more information about the lapdMouse project and available data visit
<https://doi.org/10.25820/9arg-9w56>. 

## Getting Started

**lapdMousePythonExamples** are Python 3 Jupyter notebooks (http://jupyter.org/).
The examples utilize [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) for reading data
structures and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for plotting.

**Prerequesite**: **lapdMousePythonExamples** requires installed versions of
Python 3, jupyter, pandas, and matplotlib. We recommend installing
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) which includes all necessary
dependencies.

**Example data**: All data utilized in the examples below can be downloaded from
the [lapdMouse Data Archive](http://lapdmouse.iibi.uiowa.edu/Data) website.
