# lapdMousePythonExamples

**lapdMousePythonExamples** is a collection of Python 3 Jupyter
notebooks that demonstrate how to work with data from the [Lung
anatomy + particle deposition (lapd) mouse
archive](https://lapdmouse.iibi.uiowa.edu) hosted at NIEHS. More
information about the lapdMouse project is available
<https://doi.org/10.25820/9arg-9w56>.

## Getting Started

**lapdMousePythonExamples** are Python 3 Jupyter notebooks (http://jupyter.org/).
The examples utilize [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) for reading data
structures and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for plotting.

**Prerequisites**: **lapdMousePythonExamples** requires installed versions of
Python 3, jupyter, pandas, and matplotlib. We recommend installing
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) which includes all necessary
dependencies.

**Example data**: All data utilized in the examples below can be downloaded from
the [lapdMouse Data Archive](https://lapdmouse.iibi.uiowa.edu) website.
